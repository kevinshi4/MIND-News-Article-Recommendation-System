# MIND-News-Article-Recommendation-System

INFO 442 Data Science Projects | Summer 2025 | Final Project

## Project Description
The goal of our project is to explore and understand the core principles of content-based recommendation systems by developing a news recommender system that effectively recommends articles to users. Rather than implementing complex deep learning architectures, our goal is to build and compare three content-based recommenders using relatively more basic text representation techniques: TFIDF, Word2Vec, and BERT. These models represent different levels of textual understanding from sparse, frequency-based vectors to dense semantic embeddings, and will allow us to examine how the choice of representation affects recommendation quality.
